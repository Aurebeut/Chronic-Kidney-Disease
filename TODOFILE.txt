# TO DO :
- test different value imputation methods (mean, sklearn rdy to use solution, categorical (kkn)?)
- check for k-cross validation would be better
- write unit test functions for preprocess of the data


DONE :
- check biblio causes of CKD
- deal with categorical variables = As all of the categorical columns have 2 categories we can use label encoder
- check build train/test dataset
