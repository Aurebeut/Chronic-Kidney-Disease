This repository contains material for Chronic Kidney Disease classification, using machine learning technics.
=> ADD DEFINITION OF CDK
This project is based using the dataset from the (UCI)[TBD] database.
The 2 goals are :
1. Determine risk factors for CKD
2. Determine potential CKD subtypes.

# Notebooks
The notebooks are used for Exploratory Data Analysis, to understand what's behind the dataset, and what are the available informations.
Details are the Notebook itself, but main take away points :
- Initial dataset is corrupted, with some format issues (missing column, trailing tabs).
- Data itself is not cleaned inside of the column, with cleaning to do both for numerical and categorical variables.
- There are many missing variables, that can be treated with some imputation.
- The target variable is quite balanced, with a

# Tests
In order to have a tested code, some functionalities of the code (like preprocessing) are checked with unit testing, to ensure that our functions are behaving as expected, in case we make any changes one day.
This tests can be launched the following way :
